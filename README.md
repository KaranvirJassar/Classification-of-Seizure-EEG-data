# Classification-of-Seizure-EEG-data
Exploring time frequency convolution neural network for classification of seizure eeg data


🧠 EEG Seizure Detection using CNN and CWT

This project implements an automated seizure detection system using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify EEG segments into seizure and non-seizure classes. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is also applied for time-frequency analysis and scalogram visualization.

📂 Dataset

Dataset Used: Epileptic Seizure Recognition Dataset

178 EEG features per sample

1 label column (y)

5 original classes

Balanced distribution

Total samples: ~6300

Dataset shape: (6326, 180)

Class Meaning
Label	Description
1	Seizure
2	Tumor region
3	Healthy brain area
4	Eyes closed
5	Eyes open

For seizure detection, the labels were converted to binary:

1 → Seizure

0 → Non-seizure (2,3,4,5)

⚙️ Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary column (Unnamed)

Converted multi-class problem into binary classification

Applied SMOTEENN for class balancing

Standardized features using StandardScaler

Split into Train / Validation / Test sets

2️⃣ Model Architecture (1D CNN)

The CNN architecture consists of:

Conv1D (32 filters, kernel size = 3, ReLU)

MaxPooling1D

Conv1D (64 filters, ReLU)

Conv1D (32 filters, ReLU)

MaxPooling1D

Dropout (0.25)

Flatten

Dense (32 units, ReLU)

Dense (16 units, ReLU)

Dropout (0.5)

Output Layer (Sigmoid)

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Regularization: Dropout + Early Stopping

📊 Results

Training Accuracy: ~99%

Validation Accuracy: ~97–98%
